# Project Status: In Progress
This project is currently under active development.<br>
I am building a fraud detection model designed to identify suspicious and anomalous transactions using machine learning techniques. The focus is on developing an end-to-end pipeline that covers data preparation, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.<br>
Ongoing and planned work includes:<br>
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Feature engineering for transactional and behavioral patterns
- Handling class imbalance and evaluation with appropriate metrics
- Training and tuning classification models
- Model explainability and interpretability
- Preparing the model for real-time or batch scoring<br>
Some components and documentation are still being refined as development continues.<br>
This repository reflects my iterative modeling process and will evolve into a complete fraud detection system suitable for production use.<br>
